# ALES-YDS-controller

The script I used to check my answers while preparing for YDS and ALES during the fall of 2022. YDS: 10/23/22, ALES: 11/20/22.

## Example run

```
python3 check_answers.py --exam-type YDS --exam-name 2020-YDS-1-CS-YDS1_ingilizce
```

In this example, the script assumes that the gold answers are in `YDS/Answers/Gold/2020-YDS-1-CS-YDS1_ingilizce.txt` in the script's directory, and your answers are in `YDS/Answers/Mine/2020-YDS-1-CS-YDS1_ingilizce.txt`.

* Answer sheet template (for both gold and yours)
```
1 a
2 b
3 c
```
